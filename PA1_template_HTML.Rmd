## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r assignment}
  
  ## Loading and preprocessing the data
    ## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
    ## reading in the data
    getwd()
  data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
  
  ## viewing the data table from CSV file and its dimensions, and a preview:
  View(data)
  str(data)
  head(data)
  dim(data)
  
  
  ## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
  # histogram of steps taken
  
  hist(data$steps, main = "Histogram of Steps")
  
  # total steps taken by day
  ## first change the Date column with 'as.Date()':
  data$date <- as.Date(as.character(data$date, "%Y-%m-%d"))
  daily_sum <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(Date=data$date), FUN=sum)
  View(daily_sum)
  plot(daily_sum)
  
  ## summary of steps per day including Median and Mean
  table <- summary(daily_sum$x)
  
  ## Median and Mean steps taken per day:
  print(table[3:4])
  
  
  ## What is the average daily activity pattern?
  # time series plot
  ##  (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
  ##  and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
  
  library(dplyr)
  AVG <- data %>%
    group_by(interval) %>% 
    summarise(avg = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
  AVG
  View(AVG)
  ## checking that the average vector of means is equal to the 
  ## length of the number of time intervals in the data file:
  
  dim(AVG)
  length(unique(data$interval))
  
  # plotting a line graph with average daily steps divided by interval:
  plot(AVG, type = "l", main = "AVG daily steps by interval")
  
  print("This is the interval with the maximum average steps:") 
  AVG$interval[which.max(AVG$avg)]


## Imputing missing values
  print("Total number of missing values in the data set:") 
  sum(is.na(data$steps))
  
  # filling in missing values and re-plotting the graph of daily averages:
  library(tidyr)
  library(dplyr)
  
  ## making a copy of the data set

  View(data2)
  
  ## imputing missing values with the overall mean:

  # re-doing the previous steps with missing values now added
  ## first the histogram:
  hist(data2$steps, main = "Histogram of Steps with missing values filled in")
  
  # total steps taken by day
  ## first change the Date column with 'as.Date()':
  data2$date <- as.Date(as.character(data2$date, "%Y-%m-%d"))
  daily_sum2 <- aggregate(data2$steps, by=list(Date=data2$date), FUN=sum)
  View(daily_sum2)
  plot(daily_sum2)
  
  ## summary of steps per day including Median and Mean
  table2 <- summary(daily_sum2$x)
  
  ## Median and Mean steps taken per day:
  print("Median and Mean with missing values imputed:")
  print(table2[3:4])
  
  # time series plot
  ##  (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
  ##  and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

  plot(AVG2, type = "l", main = "AVG daily steps by interval, missing values filled in")
  
  # Last part of this assignment
  ## For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here
  ## Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part
  
  ## Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels 
  ## – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date 
  ## is a weekday or weekend day.
  
  ## Make a panel plot containing a time series plot 
  ## (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
  ## and the average number of steps taken, 
  ## averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)
  ## See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an 
  ## example of what this plot should look like using simulated data
  
  str(data2)
  View(data2)
  
  ## first subsetting data into new data frames by weekdays or weekend
  weekends <- c("Saturday", "Sunday")
  > data3 <- filter(data2, weekdays %in% weekends)
  
  > weekday_list <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
  > data4 <- filter(data2, weekdays %in% weekday_list)
  
  ## checking the number of rows equals the original data set
  nrow(data2) - nrow(data3) - nrow(data4)
  
  data3$weekdays <- c("weekend")
  data4$weekdays <- c("weekday")

  ## checking that the average vector of means is equal to the 
  ## length of the number of time intervals in the data file:

  # plotting a line graph with average daily steps divided by interval:
  library(gglot2)
  
  ggplot(AVG3, aes(x = interval, y = avg, color = weekdays))+
    geom_line()+facet_grid(rows = vars(weekdays))
